# Campus_Fusion
CampusFusion is a web-based food ordering system designed specifically for college and campus environments.   It helps students quickly browse available food items, place orders, track order status, and raise complaints if needed.   The admin panel allows stall owners / canteen managers to efficiently manage menu items, orders, and user requests.
